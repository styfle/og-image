# [Screenshot as a Service](https://screenshotter.vercel.app)

Serverless service that generates dynamic screenshots on demand.


## Why use this service?

The short answer is that it would take a long time to painstakingly design and run a screenshot service.

That's where `screenshotter.vercel.app` comes in. You can simply pass the url and custom options to our service and it will return screenshots for you on the fly!
